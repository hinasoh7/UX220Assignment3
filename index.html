                    <p>In this project, we had to figure out a method for the Wellness Hub to be able to reach out to students more effectively. The Wellness Hub provides a lot of opportunities and experiences for students to improve their mental health and lifestyles as university students. After careful consideration, my group decided to create a podcast as it would reach out to students more effectively, especially with a large portion of the demographic being commuter students.</p>
